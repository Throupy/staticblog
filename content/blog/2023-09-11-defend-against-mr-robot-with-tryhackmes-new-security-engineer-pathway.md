In the modern world, digital threats loom large and data breaches make headlines almost every day. There is an ever-growing demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals, and the salaries can be attractive! But where do you start? If you have thought about a career in cybersecurity, there has never been a better time to start. And with TryHackMe's brand new Security Engineer learning path, you can pave your way towards building fundamental knowledge and becoming an expert!

### Why TryHackMe?

I've been using TryHackMe for a little over a year now, I subscribed to their paid plan after I got my feet wet and what can I say? Worth. Every. Penny. What I love about TryHackMe compared to other platforms (cough cough HackTheBox), is that, like other platforms, you can be thrown in the deep end with their CTF-style machines, or you can take a guided walkthrough of a particular subject. It is so easy to be disheartened with a CTF machine because you don't know where to start / you don't get it, but with TryHackMe's guided learning pathways, you have the supporting content you need to get through and achieve that sweet sweet root.



### What Content Is Inside The Security Engineer Pathway?

The Security Engineer learning pathway is (well.. it seems, I'm only 45% of the way through) a well-structured journey that will take you from cybersecurity novice to a competent security engieer. It covers a wide range of topics, including:

* Governance, Compliance, Risk Management, and Vulnerability Management (Trust me, it gets better!)
* Network and System Hardening, including Linux, Windows, Networks, AND CLOUD! This has been my favourite.
* Software Security 
* Incident Response, including all phases of the IR lifecycle 

The rooms within this pathway include TONS of supporting material, which I like to make notes on as I go, as well as lots of interactive game-like learning tasks. There are also completely interactive labs which are so easy to connect to with the built-in split view and attack box (it's like Mr. Robot in your browser!)

### What Do I Get Out Of It?

You may want to complete this pathway for a few reasons:

* You work in cyber security, but you are not particularly technical - excellent pathway for upskilling and learning more about buzz words such as "encryption", "MITRE ATT&CK",  or "STRIDE".
* Hands-on experience - this is not your typical udemy course, wherein you have 40 hours of a monotone 60-year-old speaking about linux kernel exploits, but rather an opportunity to get your hands dirty and implement security controls.
* Unlock Job Roles - as I touched on earlier, cybersecurity is a rapidly growing industry, and its not short of job opportunities, start now, and you won't regret it!
* It's fun!

### Conclusion

If you've dreamt about a career in cybersecurity, there is 100% no better time to start than right now. With TryHackMe's new Security Engineering guided learning pathway, you have a comprehensive and engaging resource at your fingertips. This path will not only prepare you for a career in cybersecurity but also keep you entertained for hours.

So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the Security Engineer learning path on TryHackMe and take the first step towards a rewarding career in cybersecurity. The digital realm needs heroes like you, ready to defend and secure our online world.
